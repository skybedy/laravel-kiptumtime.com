    'trans_9' => "A cadence is one of the values provided to us by most modern watch manufacturers. In our results processing, cadence is used as a control to see if the activity was actually run or recorded in some other, non-running way. <br> Of course, everything can be circumvented these days, but cadence monitoring is one of the things that tries to make that circumvention more difficult. For this reason, it's not possible to use data from cell phones alone to record results, because they don't record cadence themselves, and activity from them simply doesn't get recorded in the results.",
