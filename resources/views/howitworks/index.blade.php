                     Probably any normal person would prefer that this site didn't exist, but it is what it is and in memory of Kelvin Kiptum
this platform has been created where runners from all over the world can submit their bull runs achieved in 2:00:35, Kelvin's time.
at the Chicago Marathon on October 8, 2023, resulting in the longest distance run in 2:00:35.<br><br>

This app is completely free, fully automatic and works 24/7. It is likely that the platform's concept will change in the future
depending on the interest, this first version will last until 8.10.24 and each runner can present any number of results, with the total results
the best one will be counted. The condition for participation is that each runner has an account on Strava.<br><br>

Runs are uploaded to the app either automatically when they are uploaded to the Strava after your run, but they can also be uploaded afterwards by copying them
by copying the link to the relevant activity.<br><br>

The app accepts all runs that last 2:00:35 or longer. When a run is longer than 2:00:35, the application removes everything over that time
and subtracts the average time that was reached by 2:00:35 from the total run time.

                             At the moment the application is running in test mode and the documentation and procedures will be continuously updated.<br>
                             It is very likely that there are still some bugs in the application that will be addressed operationally.
