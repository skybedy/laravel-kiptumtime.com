             Kelvin was Kenyan and we think it would be right if any funds raised through this platform went back to Kenya and based on this fact we decided that any funds raised will be donated to charity.<br>
To this end, we have partnered with a young Kenyan non-profit <a class="underline" href="https://www.blessedcitron.com">Blessed Citron</a> and it is to them that we have decided to donate any funds

               Blessed Citron is a NGO based in Kenya, dedicated to reducing inequalities by addressing the unique challenges faced by vulnerable communities and individuals in Kenya. The organization currently has programs in gender-based violence, AI for impact, sports, and education. <br>
The organization intends to set up an arts and music centre. This centre will be more than just a space for creativityâ€”it will be a lifeline for vulnerable communities.<br>
Imagine a place where children from disadvantaged backgrounds can escape the harsh realities of their daily lives, finding hope and inspiration through art, music, and self-expression. For many, this centre will be their first chance to discover and nurture their talents, giving them the opportunity to dream big and build a brighter future.<br><br>
